    <p>As bolt begins running from his master he hears him saying "Bolt, No! Come back!" As much as Bolt loves his master he promised himself this challenge of making it to Times Square to enjoy it as much as he sees others enjoy it on the TV. Along the way Bolt is making his way through Streets, Avenues, traffic and even meeting other dogs too! The other dogs stare at him crazily as he's just running with no one holding him on the other end of his leash. With his tongue out slapping his face and his tail wagging in the air, Bolt is happy as he could ever be.
